        <h1>Credit Default Prediction Analysis</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our in-depth analysis of credit default predictions based on various machine learning models and comprehensive data analysis.</p>

        <h2>Insights from the Analysis</h2>
        
        <div class="insight">
            <h3>High Correlation Between Loan and Loan to Income</h3>
            <p>The Loan and Loan to Income variables exhibit a high correlation of 0.85, indicating that as the loan amount increases, the ratio of the loan to the individual's income also rises substantially. This could be indicative of higher financial leverage among borrowers as they opt for larger loan amounts relative to their income.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>This insight can be used to adjust lending criteria or set limits to reduce the risk of defaults by capping the loan amount based on the borrower's income, thereby ensuring that borrowers are not over-leveraged.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h3>Negative Correlation Between Age and Default</h3>
            <p>A notable negative correlation (-0.44) exists between the Age of the borrower and the Default status. Older individuals are less likely to default on loans.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>This could inform a tiered interest rate system where younger borrowers might face higher rates or stricter loan approval processes due to their higher risk of default.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h3>Skewness in Loan Distribution</h3>
            <p>The distribution of Loan amounts is positively skewed (skewness = 0.624), indicating that most of the loans are of lower amounts, but there are few very high-value loans.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>Special attention and perhaps additional approval layers could be implemented for higher loan amounts to mitigate potential default risks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h3>Outliers in Loan Amounts</h3>
            <p>There are outliers present in the Loan distribution, as identified by the IQR method. These outliers represent significantly high loan values that are much greater than typical loans issued.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>Investigating these outliers could help in identifying potential errors in data entry, exceptional credit cases, or emerging needs for financial products tailored for high-value loans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h3>Distribution of Age</h3>
            <p>The age distribution is somewhat uniformly spread but shows a slight increase in frequency at the middle ages.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>Products and services can be tailored more specifically by age group, potentially offering different products or promotions targeted at the most common age groups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h3>Default Rate</h3>
            <p>The overall default rate is about 14.15%. Knowing the distribution of defaults across different demographic and financial metrics can help in adjusting credit policies.</p>
            <h4>Business Implication</h4>
            <p>Enhance credit scoring models by integrating more demographic and loan-specific factors to better predict default likelihood.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This comprehensive analysis not only deepens our understanding of the factors that influence credit default but also provides actionable insights that can be leveraged to refine risk assessment models and develop more tailored financial products. By strategically applying these insights, the business can enhance its decision-making process, optimize risk management, and potentially increase profitability through targeted customer offerings and improved loan servicing processes.</p>
